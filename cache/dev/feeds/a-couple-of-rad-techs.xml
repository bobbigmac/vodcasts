Zulema Solis RT (R)(M) is a Mammography Technologist for 9 years and is about to start my 10th year. I knew I wanted to be an X-ray tech since the 10th grade and actively pursued this career since then. About a year ago I started my Etsy store to help other mammogram techs with badge buddy cards and also started a TikTok page to create more interest in mammography. Zulema's high school placed a significant emphasis on students taking community college classes, which were almost mandatory throughout their education. Although Zulema had a strong interest in pursuing a career in X-ray technology, her counselors lacked knowledge about the field. Despite this, she strategically focused on completing transferable community college courses, particularly in general education and science. This foresight ensured that her credits would be recognized by any future college or university she attended. Understanding that most X-ray programs require applicants to be at least 18 years old, Zulema concentrated on gathering the necessary prerequisites during high school. By the time she graduated, she was well-prepared to focus exclusively on her X-ray studies, poised to achieve her career aspirations.</p><p>Mammography is a vital yet often overlooked specialty in the field of radiology, and in this lively discussion, host Chaundria and guest Zulema dive deep into the ins and outs of pursuing a career in this area. With Zulema's ten years of experience, they explore the numerous opportunities available for radiologic technologists looking to transition into mammography, emphasizing the importance of gaining additional certifications right after X-ray school. They share personal stories and practical tips on navigating the challenges of the profession, from patient interactions to the unique skills required for mammography. Zulema highlights the significance of fostering a supportive environment within the workplace and the benefits of sharing knowledge among colleagues. This episode is packed with valuable insights, humor, and encouragement for anyone considering a career in mammography or looking to enrich their current practice.</p><p>Wrapping up their enlightening conversation, Chaundria and Zulema tackle the logistical aspects of working as a mammography technologist, such as scheduling, work-life balance, and the potential for travel opportunities. They highlight the flexibility that can come with mammography roles, contrasting them with other imaging specialties that may require more demanding hours or on-call duties. Zulema discusses her own work arrangements, illustrating how she has managed to carve out a fulfilling career while balancing personal commitments, including motherhood. This episode serves as a practical guide for aspiring mammographers, addressing how to approach job searches, negotiate work conditions, and seek out professional development opportunities. With a blend of humor and candidness, Shandria and Zulema empower listeners to pursue their passions in radiology, reinforcing the idea that a career in mammography can be both rewarding and sustainable. Their shared experiences and insights create a rich tapestry of advice and encouragement that will resonate with both seasoned professionals and newcomers alike.</p><p>Takeaways:</p><ul><li> Mammography is an essential yet underappreciated field in radiology, offering many career opportunities. </li><li> Starting a mammography career immediately after X-ray school provides a smoother transition and less stress. </li><li> Mammography technologists can enjoy flexible schedules, often avoiding weekend and holiday shifts. </li><li> Building relationships and sharing knowledge among mammography techs creates a supportive work environment. </li><li> Engaging with patients compassionately is key to successful mammography practices and personal job satisfaction. </li><li> Social media is a powerful tool for aspiring radiology...]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to A Couple of Rad Techs Podcast!

(30 Year Old Women)</itunes:title><description><![CDATA[<p>Getting a mammogram can feel like stepping onto a stage in your birthday suit—nervous, a little awkward, and definitely not your idea of a good time. In this episode, we dive into the world of mammograms and share some real-life experiences that might just resonate with you. Our guest walks us through her first encounter with this essential health check, which kicked off after a routine doctor’s visit revealed a lump. Spoiler alert: she discovered she has fibrocystic breasts, and let me tell you, that’s a whole rollercoaster of emotions! We chat about the nerves, the lack of fashion choices (hello, hospital gowns!), and how every appointment feels like a mini anxiety fest, even if you’ve been through it before. So, grab your favorite beverage and tune in as we unwrap this topic with some light-hearted banter and a sprinkle of wisdom!</p><p>Takeaways:</p><ul><li> Getting a mammogram can be nerve-wracking, especially when you're unsure about the results. </li><li> It’s totally normal to feel a bit awkward when getting undressed for medical exams, but hey, we’ve all been there! </li><li> Experiencing fibrocystic breasts can lead to some interesting doctor visits, so don't sweat it too much. </li><li> Remembering your first mammogram experience can bring back those feelings of anxiety, but they get easier over time. </li><li> Having a supportive doctor makes a huge difference when facing the jitters of a mammogram appointment. </li><li> Embracing the awkwardness of medical exams is part of the journey to better health, so let’s laugh it off together! </li></ul><br/><p>The subject of mammograms might not be the most glamorous topic, but our guest took it to a whole new level of relatability. With a candid recount of her first mammogram experience, she peeled back the layers of anxiety, awkwardness, and ultimately empowerment that come with such an essential health screening. It all started about seven years ago when she found a lump during a routine exam—cue the dramatic music! The moment she entered that doctor’s office, she was met with a mix of emotions: fear of the unknown, worry about the results, and the classic dread of getting undressed in front of a stranger. Can I get an amen? </p><p>Her story beautifully illustrated the tension that many women feel in these situations. We’ve all been there, right? But what really stood out was how she managed to find humor in the awkwardness of the moment. It’s like she was saying, “Yeah, it’s weird, but let’s laugh about it!” Her journey from nervous patient to empowered woman was not only inspiring but also a powerful reminder of the importance of taking control of our health. After all, if we can laugh in the face of awkwardness, we can tackle anything!</p><p><br></p><p>As the conversation unfolded, we delved deeper into the significance of regular screenings and how they play a vital role in our health journeys. It’s not just about the mammogram itself; it’s about fostering conversations around women’s health and breaking the stigma that often surrounds it. By the end of this episode, it felt like we had created a safe space to talk about something that’s often brushed under the rug. So, whether you’re gearing up for your first mammogram or just want to hear a genuine story filled with laughter and truth, this episode is for you.

In this episode, they delve into the world of radiation therapy and discuss various aspects of the profession.<br/><br/>Laura begins by highlighting the emotional toll of working in radiation therapy, particularly with cancer patients, and the importance of self-care and work-life balance to navigate these challenges. While salary is not the sole motivation, Laura emphasizes the significance of compensation for financial security and quality of life.<br/><br/>They also shed light on the career opportunities in radiology, specifically in radiation therapy, which only requires a two-year education but offers a good income and the ability to support oneself and family.

However, the job satisfaction and impact on patients make it all worth it.<br/><br/>The discussion then moves on to the technological advancements in radiation therapy, such as adaptive therapy, which allows treatment plans to be adjusted based on daily tumor size.

Smith, a dedicated radiology application specialist and adjunct professor, as we dive into the fascinating world of medical imaging and radiation therapy. Brandon emphasizes that radiology is not just about taking X-rays; it encompasses a wide range of critical procedures that significantly impact patient care, including interventional techniques that can save lives. With over 20 years of experience, he shares insights on how professionals in this field can advocate for themselves and redefine their roles beyond the label of a "button pusher." The discussion also highlights the importance of organizations like the ASRT in promoting professionalism and supporting the growth of radiologic technologists. Tune in to discover how to elevate the perception of radiology as a vital and competitive career choice, not just a backup plan.</p><p>Brandon Smith, a proud Houston native, embraces his identity as simply "Brandon." While some may question the absence of credentials and resumes, Brandon believes that being true to oneself holds immense significance. Born and raised in the bayou of Houston, Texas, Brandon feels a deep connection to his roots and plans to always return home. With a technologist background that spans generations, as his father has been involved in medical imaging since the 80s, Brandon brings a unique perspective to his work. His exposure to imaging sets him apart and fuels his passion for the field.</p><p>On this episode of A Couple of Rad Techs Podcast, our guest, Brandon Smith, takes us on a journey through his experience in radiology school and his passion for interventional radiology. Brandon discusses his rotations, particularly in interventional radiology, where he fell in love with the modality and learned about the crucial role of radiology nurses in assisting with sedation and working closely with technologists and doctors. In interventional radiology, everyone, including nurses, technologists, and doctors, scrubs in together and works as a team, with technologists playing a vital role in understanding procedures and drawing up certain things.</p><p>But it's not all about the technical aspects of the profession. Brandon also delves into the importance of personal accountability and questioning whether professional organizations like the ASRT are fulfilling their needs and whether they, as individuals, are fulfilling their own needs. He emphasizes the significance of personal accountability and the role it plays, even when feeling dissatisfied. Brandon highlights the importance of championing the purpose of others and measuring personal performance by service rather than ego.</p><p>As the episode progresses, Brandon shares his transition from clinical practice to teaching and his involvement in applications in the radiology department, specializing in improving clinical workflows and understanding the importance of efficient workflows in patient care management and healthcare delivery. He stresses that medical imaging is a service line that supports other service lines and should not be undervalued.</p><p>The conversation also touches on the ASRT and its role in providing professional development and continuing education credits. Brandon encourages young people to consider careers in radiology, highlighting the flexibility and opportunities available. He believes that the ASRT can play a stronger role in helping technologists become more professional and improving the image of the modality. Brandon also emphasizes the importance of professionalism in the field and how one's behavior and presentation determine how others treat them.</p><p>Disclaimer: This post contains affiliate links.

Speaker A initiates the conversation by sharing her personal narrative, which includes her extensive background in healthcare and her familial connections to cancer. This personal touch sets a heartfelt tone as the duo explores how dietitians like Holster can bridge the gap between medical advice and patient fears about food. Holster articulates her mission to provide accurate, science-based information on nutrition, aiming to empower patients to make informed choices rather than succumbing to restrictive diets driven by fear.</p><p><br></p><p>Holster’s approach, which emphasizes a balanced, all-foods-fit philosophy, is refreshing in a landscape often dominated by fad diets and misconceptions. She skillfully dismantles prevalent myths, such as the belief that sugar directly feeds cancer, arguing instead for moderation and the inclusion of a variety of foods that promote health. The conversation also touches on the emotional connections people have with food, particularly in the context of cultural and familial traditions. Speaker A and Holster discuss how understanding these connections can help clients navigate their dietary choices without the burden of guilt or fear.</p><p><br></p><p>The discussion evolves into a broader examination of self-care, highlighting nutrition as an integral component of overall wellness, particularly for those recovering from cancer treatment. Holster provides practical advice on how to introduce more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains into daily meals while still enjoying life’s pleasures, such as occasional indulgences. The episode concludes with a powerful reminder of the importance of a holistic approach to health, one that incorporates emotional well-being, stress management, and a supportive community. This enriching conversation not only educates listeners about cancer nutrition but also inspires them to embrace a balanced lifestyle that prioritizes both health and happiness.</p><p>Takeaways:</p><ul><li> Self-care is essential, especially for those dealing with cancer, to improve overall well-being. </li><li> Nutrition should focus on adding healthy foods rather than eliminating favorites to avoid feelings of deprivation. </li><li> Understanding the emotional connections to food can help clients make better dietary choices. </li><li> Quality of life is crucial; finding balance in nutrition and enjoyment is key for lasting health. </li><li> It's important to meet clients where they are in their dietary habits and preferences. </li><li> Entrepreneurship requires careful assessment of personal happiness and the stresses of self-employment. </li></ul><br/><p>Links referenced in this episode:</p><ul><li><a href="https://thecancernutritionist" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thecancernutritionist</a></li></ul><br/><p>self care, cancer nutrition, registered dietitian, oncology nutrition, plant-based diet, food fears, nutrition myths, quality of life, cancer prevention, health coaching, dietary choices, symptom management, holistic health, nutrition tips, healthy eating habits, emotional eating, cancer recovery, wellness podcast, nutritionist advice, lifestyle changes</p><p>Mentioned in this episode:</p><p><strong>1 Electric</strong></p><p><strong>Stay healthy with Juice Plus</strong></p><p>https://us.juiceplus.com/products?commSysPartnerID=10628239</p><p><strong>Stay healthy with Juice Plus</strong></p><p>https://us.juiceplus.com/products?commSysPartnerID=10628239</p>]]></content:encoded><link><![CDATA[https://ccimagingservices.com/podcast/how-to-eat-well-and-live-better-after-cancer-treatment]]></link><guid isPermaLink="false">Buzzsprout-8510576</guid><itunes:image href="https://artwork.captivate.fm/c61f3921-93ed-41c8-96b2-2d19fdaf492b/7as1sasbmmgwwop8pjkwza46rew7.jpg"/><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 11:00:00 -0500</pubDate><enclosure url="https://podcasts.captivate.fm/media/bbb2de00-1fa7-4c8a-a1b4-415641ceeaa3/8510576-we-are-really-busting-common-cancer-myths-with-the-canc.mp3" length="21060358" type="audio/mpeg"/><itunes:duration>29:15</itunes:duration><itunes:explicit>false</itunes:explicit><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><itunes:season>3</itunes:season><itunes:episode>4</itunes:episode><podcast:episode>4</podcast:episode><podcast:season>3</podcast:season><itunes:summary>Tuesday Hoelscher is a registered dietitian nutritionist who specializes in oncology nutrition.
