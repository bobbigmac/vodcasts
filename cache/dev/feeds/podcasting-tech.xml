Podcasts are a valuable source of information, education, and entertainment. If you are interested to know how to make your Podcast accessible to billions across the globe beyond smartphones you don’t want to miss this episode. If you want to claim a piece of the 3 billion–plus listeners not using iPhones or Androids, this episode is a must-listen.</p><p>Today on episode 50, of the PodcastingTech Show, host Mathew Passy chats with Tom Barrasso, founder and developer of <a href="https://podlp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PodLP</a>, the innovative app that brings podcasts to feature phones (“dumb phones”) around the world. If you’ve ever assumed your listeners all have iPhones or Androids, this episode will seriously open your eyes!</p><p>Tom Barrasso is a software developer and entrepreneur based in New Zealand who created PodLP out of a desire for digital detox—and a personal challenge to prove that even “dumb phones” could be smart about podcasts. His unique expertise bridges podcast technology and truly global access.</p><p>We discuss exactly how PodLP makes podcasts accessible to listeners in emerging markets in&nbsp; India and beyond. Tom unpacks how PodLP is breaking Podcast barriers with feature Phone technology,, the surprising size and diversity of the feature phone landscape, and why Western podcasters should be paying attention.</p><p>You’ll learn about the technical challenges Tom faced building for this underserved audience, how PodLP works on devices most of us never think about, and what this means for your show’s global reach.</p><p>IN THIS EPISODE, WE COVER:</p><ul><li><strong>Why Tom built PodLP:</strong> How a pandemic project turned into a worldwide feature phone podcast platform, and why digital detox was the spark. (1:00)</li><li><strong>The size of the feature phone market: </strong>India, the U.S., and beyond—find out who’s actually buying feature phones in 2024 (hint: it’s not just seniors!). (5:20)</li><li><strong>Why and how feature phone users matter for podcasting:</strong> Tom explains why emerging markets are the next frontier for English (and non-English) podcast consumption—and what makes audio perfect there. (7:00)</li><li><strong>How PodLP works:</strong> What’s different on a tiny screen, what features you’ll recognize, and why every PodLP download equals a real listen. (8:55)</li><li><strong>How to get your podcast listed: </strong>Good news—if you’re in Podcast Index, you’re already there. If not, you might be missing out on millions of potential listeners.
